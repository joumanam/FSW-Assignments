Kindly take into consideration the below, as some of the required features were missing:

-There are two homepages, with very minor differences (index-customer and index-store).

-Products are shown in the homepage and in the shop page (for the customers) or store page (for the sellers). 
 The two pages should have been different, allowing each type of user to have exclusive features like adding to cart for the customer, 
 or editing the quantity or price for the seller, but I was short on time and could not implement it.

-I preferred to keep a clean layout and insist on the use of alerts applied in the “login” page and “add items”, (try it it’s fun) 
 instead of the user-to-product id, because I knew I did not have the time to do the work that comes after it (each seller has a store, adding products to cart, etc..).

-The above has also affected the “cart” table (empty with no links to other tables).

-Template used: https://themefisher.com/products/aviato-e-commerce-template/


Please note that this was an assignment and not a full project. Some features are yet to be completed.

Thank you !
