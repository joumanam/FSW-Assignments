Hello Elias, I'd appreciate you take into consideration the below regarding the implemented features:

- The login / SignUp (front-end / back-end).
- The search (front-end / back-end).
- The friends list (front-end / back-end).
- The logout (front-end / back-end).
- The add friends (API only, no front-end).
- The edit profile page (front-end only).

- Pending requests (Not implemented).
- Block users (Not implemented).
- Notifications (Not implemented).

N.B:The home page is actually the "Find Friends" page (or the search page).


-- Template -- 

Please note that the template I have chosen consisted only of the login page,
so excuse the ugly design :') I had to do everything manually which also took some
time.

Thank you !
